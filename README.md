## Setup
Make sure you are using up to date versions of R and Rstudio.
Clone repository and run package_install.Rmd first. 
Then you may run any of the rmd files in the repository.

## Results
There is an easy and accurate model to predict your body fat. It requires on 4 measurements and you probably already know your weight. The other measurements are abdomen, wrist and forearm circumference which are not difficult to find using a tape measurer.

There is also a more accurate model which uses thigh circumference and age but it's harder to recall.
